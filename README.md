# Schemer

A simple compiler of a subset of Scheme language.

## Introduction

In this project, we will write a compiler for a subset of Scheme that produces assembly language code for the 64-bit x86-64 architecture.

Actually, the project is comprised of 15 labs, with each of them having its own testcases.

Each lab is based on the precedented one, so make sure all testcases of previous labs are passed when you are ready to a new lab.

The subset of Scheme will grow larger as the project progresses. The compiler will also become more sophisticated in other ways, primarily to generate more efficient code.

Don't be afraid of x86-64 assembly language.

Indeed, it's really confusing when you first use it, but you will be skilled with it in just 2 days since all we need is just a very tiny part of it.
